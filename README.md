        ii) Lots of data at a time doesn't look great.
        iii) Searching a data in the spreadsheed isn't easy.
        iv) Adding new data or deleting existing data is also a hectic task.
        
    -Benefits of this App
        i) So, this application was desined such a way that if we need to see all the data, 
        we'll open it in read only mode so that it has no chance of data loss.
        
        ii) Addition and deletion of data is done for a paticular data at a time 
        with a very efficient and fast search.
